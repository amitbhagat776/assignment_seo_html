    <h2>Favicon </h2>
    <p>
      A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon associated with a
      website or webpage. It is typically displayed in the browser's address
      bar, tabs, bookmarks, and in the browser's history to help users quickly
      identify a website. Favicons are usually square in shape and are typically
      16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels in size, although larger sizes are often used
      for higher resolution displays.

    <h4>Illustrative example:</h4>
    <p>
      When you have a list of open tabs in your browser, the favicons help you
      to quickly identify the different web pages. Favicons are also displayed
      in the bookmark bar and history list, making it easier to find the
      websites that you visit frequently.</p>
